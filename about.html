            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-7">My creative soul was never quite settled as I moved from one home business to another. I finally found my niche with a company that was popular to the stay-at-home mom crowd in 2004 and began to learn and understand the power of networking. What I found with this company though, was that I was still trading time for money. It was not what I had in mind. I knew there had to be a better way than leaving the family<br>every night to go have a party!<br><br>Somewhere along the way, I learned about design and decorating and fell in love with the industry! From that point forward I built a large business, designing custom pieces and re-imagining spaces for my clients. I loved it, and with my kids now all in school full time, it was something I could pursue without the guilt of leaving them with a sitter. This led to many fun adventures, including Matthew and I being on an episode of Flea Market Flip on HGTV! Still one of the coolest experiences I have been a part of!<br><br>What happened next our family likes to call a "Davis" moment... defined as: something totally off the wall stupid happening! I was injured in a car wreck which led to back surgery and Matthew's company was bought out...downsizing all upper management. So, he was jobless and I felt useless! We decided to do what any reasonable family would do...we opened a brick and mortar store, which lasted 12 months exactly... until we were completely burnt out, exhausted and feeling fairly hopeless!<br><br>I will skip a lot of the details in between, but from that point forward, my dreams shifted. My health was not good and I was severely depressed. Flashbacks of my dad and his declining health plagued my mind and I was certain that I was on a downward spiral to the end. I was living in constant chronic back pain. Just before my 45th birthday I had hit an all-time low. It was this low, that led me to exactly what I had been waiting for all of these years. I did the hardest thing I had ever done...I reached out for help. I had been watching a friend for 2 years and I just had to know, <br>why was she so happy and healthy?<br><br>Fast forward to today. I am now working with an amazing company helping people get their health on track and their finances! In just 7 short weeks after starting with this company I had achieved their top rank and was paying our mortgage, our homeowners insurance and the taxes on our South Jersey home! My health was the best it had ever been and I finally had found something I could be completely passionate about. Through this experience I have not only found a way to truly live my best life, but to empower other women to do the same! Every day we are changing the lives of hundreds of women, because I didn't give up...because I decided to give myself one more shot!<br><br>I started Midlife Mommas to empower and educate other women who have hit that same brick wall. Mommas who have given everything to raising their kids and have lost themselves along the way. Their health, happiness and purpose are all a big question in their mind! I have found that, in our aloneness, we have a community that we didn't know existed!<br><br>I am now speaking to groups of women around the country, giving encouragement and direction in life and business. I am helping them rediscover their purpose and build a foundation for their future. I am showing women everywhere that Midlife is the momentum shift that they have been waiting for. It is a license to stop caring what other people think and to pursue their dreams. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Are you ready to join the Momevement? We'd love to have you!</div>
